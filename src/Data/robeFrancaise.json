      "description": "The Zoomlan Island, inspired by the book-land(scape) metaphor, invites the player/reader to embark on the small island of ZOOMLAND and explore the unknown territory by looking for signs and symbols that represent different heuristic perspectives and thematic entry points from which the content of the book can be discovered and explored.

      "description": "In the game, the player/reader has to collect the chapter cards assigned to the various objects scattered across the island. These objects, according to their size or position relative to the ground, can stand for three conceptual standpoints – bird’s-eye view, overhead view and ground view –, one of which is attributed to each chapter.

      "description": " From this high vantage point, you can see where you're headed and identify potential paths. But to truly explore and understand what the island holds, the player/reader needs to get closer. Moving in, they will encounter a world filled with signs, symbols, and objects that guide you through the book’s themes."

      "description": "As they navigate the island, the players/readers meet its inhabitants. These aren't ordinary island dwellers — they are the editors, the publisher, and the game creators themselves. They love playing tricks, offering clues, and challenging you to guess where chapters might be found. Not to worry; their mischief is always helpful. They are here to guide the players/readers, providing insight and context as they explore this unique landscape of knowledge."

      "description": "Objects are more than just decorations—they are metaphors for the book’s contents. Take, for example, a giant <em>radio telescope</em>: this object unlocks the chapter “Zoom-in, Zoom-out, and Zoom-zero Modes to Understand Religious Sculptures.” as it symbolizes humanity's quest to connect with the vast, unseen forces of the universe — it embodies our desire to understand and represent the divine.",

      "description": "A stomacher was originally worn over the long front opening. This triangular insert which has not survived in the case of the blue dress, concealed the undergarment. It was attached to the dress neckline with pins.</br> The entire inside of the dress’ bodice is stabilized with whalebone stays. Lacing at the back allowed it to be adjusted to fit the wearer. A long linen shirt and a separate laced bodice were worn under the dress.",

Like the sleeves, they are lined with linen and additionally stiffened with paper in the cuffs. White lace cuffs peeked out from underneath, but these have not survived."

The woven background patterns repeat every 43,5 to 45 centimeters. A wave shaped garland of flowers with white, five-petal blossoms and blue pointed leaves branch off in the lower third into large bouquets of flowers in different shades. The space between the flower bouquets and the lace band is furthermore filled with groups of small, white scattered flowers."

      "description": "Floral ornaments, flowers and blossoms have in all times been central elements of textile ornamentation and patterning. They can be naturalistic, stylized, invented or prescinded. They can be woven into the fabric, printed or painted on the fabric. Floral elements can be realized via embroidery, via knitting, crochet and made in other textile techniques as lace-making. Here the filigree flower patterns are not embroidered but woven in."

      "description": "18th century textiles reflect the taste of the time for gardens and individual flowers, such as roses. They were usually arranged loosely but symmetrically on the textile. The symbolic power of flowers played a major role in the occasion for which the dress was worn.<br/>A silk fabric of this kind with tendrils arranged in waves, flower garlands, bouquets and lace ribbons was one of the most popular fabric patterns designed and produced in a multitude of variations in all European centres of silk weaving between 1740 and 1775."

      "description": "The comparison and analysis of the dress and fabric in the context of fashion history support a dating of around 1760. Investigations into the family history of the potential wearer leads to the hypothesis that it is Juliana Luisa Mauritia Eck’s wedding dress for the occasion in 1757."
